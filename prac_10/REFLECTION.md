3. Expand my capabilities and add practical relevance, Through weekly practical tasks, let's build up our knowledge and skills,
starting with easy tasks and gradually increasing their difficulty to expand our abilities. Weekly tasks that are as practical
and applicable to the real world as possible help us see the relevance of what we are learning.
